##  Report Overview

The report presents both the fabrication workflow and the electrical/optical characterization of a commercial silicon photodiode.

### Covered Topics:

- **Packaging process:**
  - Wafer dicing  
  - Die bonding  
  - Wire bonding

- **Characterization techniques:**
  - Dark current  
  - Responsivity  
  - Junction capacitance  
  - Response time  
  - Transmission Line Method (TLM)

Experimental results were obtained using a **Hamamatsu S2744-09** silicon PIN photodiode and compared against the manufacturer's datasheet.
